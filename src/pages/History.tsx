            Our Story
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Tanyigbe is an Eʋe community with roots in the broader Eʋe migration history. The Eʋe people trace their origins to Notsie in present-day Togo, where our ancestors lived before embarking on a journey in search of freedom and better living conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Along the migration journey, our people passed through areas such as Gbélé (near the Aburi Mountains) and Amamprobi in Akwapem, before moving through parts of the Volta region in search of fertile land, water, and security.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our oral history recalls a significant episode at Dzifadzi, where two brothers became separated from the main group during the migration, compelling them to settle there and start their families. Tanyigbe remains connected to the Dzifadzi community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our community settled for an extended period at Klɔbɔ (Gborxome or Old Town), where social structures, farming practices, and communal life were firmly established. In the late 20th century, our people relocated from the Old Town to our present location along the Ho-Kpalimé corridor, where Tanyigbe continues to grow and thrive today.

                  The Tanyigbe Traditional Area operates under a hierarchical governance system typical of Eʋe communities. A paramount chief serves as the overall traditional authority, supported by divisional chiefs from each of the four divisions: Anyigbe, Etoe, Atidze, and Dzafe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The traditional council comprises the paramount chief, divisional chiefs, and elders who provide guidance on customary matters, dispute resolution, and community development initiatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This structure maintains continuity with traditional Eʋe governance while adapting to contemporary administrative requirements.

            Our Eʋe Heritage
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-6 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Tanyigbe is part of the Eʋe ethnic group, one of Ghana's major ethnic groups with populations also in Togo and Benin. The Eʋe language (Eʋegbe) serves as the primary language of communication within the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              The community shares cultural practices common to Eʋe communities, including traditional music, dance forms such as Borborbor, and customary ceremonies that mark significant life events and seasonal celebrations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like many Ghanaian communities, Tanyigbe has experienced religious transformation, with Christianity becoming predominant while traditional beliefs continue to influence cultural practices and worldview.
            </p>
            <p>
              The preservation of Eʋe language and cultural practices remains important to community identity, particularly through festivals, traditional ceremonies, and educational initiatives. Each year, usually in September, our community comes together to celebrate the Yam Festival (TAYAFEST), a key cultural milestone marked by thanksgiving, unity, and the reaffirmation of shared values and heritage.

            <p>
              Today, our community is organized into four divisions—Anyigbe, Etoe, Atidze, and Dzafe—united under one paramount chief. The Tanyigbe Traditional Area operates within the Ho District administrative framework while maintaining its traditional governance structures.
            </p>
            <p>
              The community continues to preserve Eʋe cultural heritage through festivals, language maintenance, and traditional ceremonies. Development priorities include education, healthcare infrastructure, agricultural advancement, and maintaining connections with diaspora community members who contribute to local development initiatives.
